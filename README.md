# 1D track simulator.

The environment is a 1D line onto which an agent can go right or left. The agent
uses a UCT like policy in order to reach its goal.

Every parameters such as the state transition function, the reward function,
the model of the agent, the shape of the world, the action space etc. are 
tunable. In order to do so, one should directly modify the source code and
recompile using the provided Makefile.
